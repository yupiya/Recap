This is the supervised learning part of the project which is already deprecated. 

The overall goal is to generate the abstract from the whole paper by using seq2seq and Glove-6B as the embeddings. 

However it only reach low accuracy and high loss in the experiment.

To run the program, make sure you have installed the pandas, numpy, sklearn and keras. Anaconda is recommended. If you have Anaconda, type:

```bash
conda install keras
```

If you want to run with GPU, see all prerequisite here:
